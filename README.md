# RatioGrid
A pure HTML/CSS solution for creating beautiful responsive thumbnail grids.
	
## Goal
A collection of thumbnail images of any size or ratio, displayed in a tiled grid that expands and contracts with the containing element (or browser window).

### Additional requirements
* Images and their containers must maintain ratio as their parent element changes size.
* Images should be centered both vertically and horizontally within their containers.
* Allow for titles and captions below images.
